# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch  

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This project contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, aimed at providing a clearer understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.  

## Current Content  

This repository currently includes:  

- **Attention Mechanism**: An implementation of the Attention mechanism from scratch, which is a key component in many modern neural network architectures, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
