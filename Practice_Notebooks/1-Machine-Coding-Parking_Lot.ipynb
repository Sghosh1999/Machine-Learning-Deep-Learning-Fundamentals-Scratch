    "# Machine Coding Interview Question: Design a Parking Lot System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a **Parking Lot System** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system should be able to manage parking slots for different types of vehicles (e.g., Car, Bike, Truck), handle parking and unparking operations, and calculate parking fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parking Lot Initialization**\n",
    "    - The parking lot should be initialized with a given number of slots for each vehicle type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Park Vehicle**\n",
    "    - Park a vehicle in the nearest available slot for its type.\n",
    "    - If no slot is available, return an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unpark Vehicle**\n",
    "    - Unpark a vehicle using its registration number.\n",
    "    - Calculate and return the parking fee based on the duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Display Parking Lot Status**\n",
    "    - Show the current status of all parking slots (occupied/free, vehicle details).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fee Calculation**\n",
    "    - Implement a simple fee structure (e.g., flat rate per hour for each vehicle type).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional Functionalities (for bonus)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for multiple floors.\n",
    "- Different fee structures for different vehicle types.\n",
    "- Search for a vehicle by registration number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Design Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.\n",
    "- Suggested classes: `ParkingLot`, `ParkingSlot`, `Vehicle` (with subclasses `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`), `Ticket`, `FeeModel`.\n",
    "- Use appropriate data structures for efficient lookup and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize parking lot with 10 car slots, 5 bike slots, 2 truck slots\n",
    "parking_lot = ParkingLot(car_slots=10, bike_slots=5, truck_slots=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Park vehicles\n",
    "ticket1 = parking_lot.park_vehicle(Car(\"KA-01-HH-1234\"))\n",
    "ticket2 = parking_lot.park_vehicle(Bike(\"KA-01-HH-9999\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unpark vehicle\n",
    "fee = parking_lot.unpark_vehicle(ticket1.registration_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display status\n",
    "parking_lot.display_status()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python code implementing the above functionalities.\n",
    "- Proper class diagrams (optional, can be described in markdown).\n",
    "- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time:** 1 hour  \n",
    "**Difficulty:** Medium  \n",
    "**Focus:** OOP design, data structures, code readability, and extensibility."

    "### 1. **Problem Understanding**\n",
    "   - Start by explaining the problem statement: \"We need to design a Parking Lot System using OOP principles to manage parking slots for different vehicle types (Car, Bike, Truck), handle parking/unparking operations, and calculate parking fees.\"\n",
    "   - Highlight the requirements:\n",
    "     - Parking Lot Initialization\n",
