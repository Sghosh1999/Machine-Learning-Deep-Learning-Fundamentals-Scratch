    "## What is `deque`?\n",
    "`deque` (pronounced \"deck\") stands for \"double-ended queue.\" It is a data structure provided by Python's `collections` module that allows you to efficiently add and remove elements from both ends of the queue. It is implemented as a doubly-linked list, making it highly efficient for operations at both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "`deque` is particularly useful when you need a queue-like structure with fast appends and pops from both ends. It is thread-safe and can be bounded to limit the maximum number of elements.\n",

    "- **Efficient**: Provides O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations at both ends.\n",
